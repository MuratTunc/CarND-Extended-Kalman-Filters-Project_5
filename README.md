Extended-Kalman-Filter
Udacity CarND Term 1, Project 5 - Extended Kalman Filters

Project Basics
In this project, I used C++ to write a program taking in radar and lidar data to track position using Extended Kalman Filters.

The code will make a prediction based on the sensor measurement and then update the expected position. See files in the 'src' folder for the primary C++ files making up this project.

You can make a local set up or use Udacity Workspace to implement the code and simulator.
We have a data which has radar and lidar sensor measurements.We will use these to achive this project.
